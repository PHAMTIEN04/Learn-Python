# Import necessary libraries from Selenium
from selenium import webdriver

# Alerts/Popups
# -------------
# To work with alerts and popups, you can use the following methods:
# `switch_to.alert` - Switch to the active alert.
# `myalert.text` - Get the text from the alert.
# `myalert.accept()` - Accept the alert.
# `myalert.dismiss()` - Dismiss the alert.

# Example usage:
myalert = driver.switch_to.alert
alert_text = myalert.text  # Get the text from the alert
myalert.accept()  # Accept the alert
# myalert.dismiss()  # Dismiss the alert

# Authentication Popup
# --------------------
# To handle an authentication popup, you can use the syntax: http://username:password@test.com.
# For example: http://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth

# Frames/Iframes
# --------------
# To switch between frames or iframes in Selenium:
# - Use `switch_to.frame(name_of_the_frame)` to switch by the frame's name.
# - Use `switch_to.frame(id_of_the_frame)` to switch by the frame's ID.
# - Use `switch_to.frame(webelement)` to switch using a WebElement.
# - Use `switch_to.frame(0)` to switch by index (0 is the first frame).
# - Use `switch_to.default_content()` to switch back to the main content.
# - Use `switch_to.parent_frame()` to switch to the parent frame.
# - To handle inner frames, you can nest switch_to.frame() calls to navigate to nested iframes.

# Example usage:
driver.switch_to.frame("frame_name")  # Switch to a frame by its name
driver.switch_to.default_content()  # Switch back to the main content

# Browser Windows
# --------------
# To switch between browser windows:
# - Use `switch_to.window(windowID)` to switch to a specific window.
# - `current_window_handle` returns the window ID of the single browser window.
# - `window_handles` returns a list of window IDs for multiple browser windows.

# Example usage:
windowID = driver.current_window_handle  # Get the ID of the current window
windowIDs = driver.window_handles  # Get a list of all open window IDs
driver.switch_to.window(windowIDs[0])  # Switch to the first window

# Additional notes:
# - Make sure to have the appropriate driver initialized before using these methods.
# - Ensure that you have imported the necessary Selenium modules.
